# Microsoft Power Bi Report on Student Attitude and Behavior 

### Introduction

The objective of this project is to analyze and understand various factors influencing student attitudes, behaviors, and academic performance. By leveraging Microsoft Power BI, we aim to visualize and interpret data to uncover patterns and insights that can guide educational strategies and support services.

## Goals and Objectives
- Analyze academic performance: Identify correlations with the college marks and other variables like study time, hobbies, and stress levels.
- Understand student preferences: Explore how preferences for study environments and part-time jobs impact academic success and career aspirations.
- Evaluate student satisfaction: Assess the satisfaction levels with chosen degree programs and their willingness to pursue related careers.
- Identify stress factors: Determine the primary sources of stress among students and how they affect overall performance and well-being.
- Examine social influences: Investigate the impact of social media usage and financial status on student attitudes and academic outcomes.

## Data Collection and Preparation

- The sample data set for Microsoft Power Bi Report on student Attitude and Behavior has been taken from kaggle.com
- Data Sources: The data comprises various columns including academic marks, personal attributes, behavioral metrics, and preferences. The data is collected through surveys and academic records.
- Data Cleaning: Ensure the data is clean by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.
- Data Transformation: Use Power Query Editor to transform the data, such as merging tables and creating calculated columns for deeper analysis.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
 
- Performance Metrics: Visualize academic performance (College marks) to identify trends and outliers for there job satisfaction.
- Behavioral Insights: Analyze daily studying time, hobbies, and social media usage to understand their impact on academic performance and stress levels.
- Preference Analysis: Visualize data on preferred study environments and part-time job participation to see how these preferences correlate with academic success and satisfaction.
- Stress and Satisfaction: Use charts to display the relationship between stress levels, financial status, and overall satisfaction with the degree program.

# Conclusion

By analyzing the data using Power BI, we can derive actionable insights into student behaviors and attitudes. These insights can inform policies and support services aimed at enhancing academic performance, reducing stress, and improving overall student satisfaction.

# Future Work

- Deeper Analysis: Perform more detailed statistical analyses to understand causation.
- Broader Data Collection: Incorporate more variables and data points, such as mental health indicators and specific course performance.
- Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning models to predict future academic performance and identify students at risk of low performance or high stress.

# Summary

This project demonstrates the power of Microsoft Power BI in transforming raw data into meaningful insights. By focusing on various aspects of student life, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis that can help educational institutions improve their strategies and support systems for better student outcomes.
